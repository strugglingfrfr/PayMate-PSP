## What is PayMate?

Payment Service Providers (PSPs) need to pre-fund settlement accounts across markets before processing merchant payouts. Capital sits idle, cross-border movement takes days, and FX spreads eat margins.

PayMate replaces this with an on-chain credit pool:
- **PSPs** draw USDC instantly for settlement prefunding and repay with fees
- **Investors** deposit USDC and earn a guaranteed 5% fixed APY from PSP fees
- **Chainlink CRE** automates yield distribution every 7 days and handles liquidity shortfalls
- **Uniswap** converts non-USDC repayments (EURC, USDT) and sources external liquidity
- **AI Agents** assess credit risk via nanopayments on Arc before every drawdown

> **Note:** Due to testnet faucet limits (20 USDC per request from Circle faucet), the demo operates at a smaller scale (e.g. $20 drawdown limit instead of $200,000). All logic, fee calculations, and yield mechanics work identically at any scale.

## Architecture

```
Frontend (Next.js + wagmi + RainbowKit)
    ↓ REST API
Backend (Express + MongoDB)  ←→  AI Agents (Nanopayments)
    ↓ ethers.js                        ↓ x402 protocol
Smart Contracts (Arc)        ←→  CRE Workflow (Chainlink DON)
  Pool.sol                              ↓ Confidential HTTP
  YieldReserve.sol                  Uniswap Trading API
                                        ↓
                                  Circle Gateway (bridge)
```

**Flow:**
1. Admin initializes pool with parameters (drawdown limit, PSP rate, investor APY)
2. PSP registers, submits KYB (25+ fields), admin scores with 14-criteria KYR matrix
3. Investor deposits USDC into pool
4. PSP requests drawdown → AI agent pays for credit risk assessment via nanopayments → if approved, USDC transferred to PSP
5. If pool lacks liquidity → CRE calls Uniswap API to source USDC cross-chain
6. PSP repays in any stablecoin → if non-USDC, CRE converts via Uniswap
7. Fee goes to YieldReserve, principal back to pool
8. Every 7 days, CRE distributes yield to investors from YieldReserve
9. Investor withdraws principal + earned yield

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the live deployment

Visit https://paymate-psp.vercel.app — everything works out of the box. Connect MetaMask on Arc Testnet to interact with contracts.

### Option 2: Run locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, MetaMask

```bash
git clone https://github.com/strugglingfrfr/PayMate-PSP.git
cd PayMate-PSP/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:3000 (backend API included via Next.js API routes)
```

The frontend includes the full backend API at `/api/*` — no separate backend server needed. MongoDB Atlas is configured in the deployment.

### 5. Add Arc Testnet to MetaMask

## Sponsor Integration Details

### Arc by Circle

**Smart Contracts ($3K track)**

PayMate's Pool and YieldReserve contracts are deployed on Arc Testnet and demonstrate advanced stablecoin logic:

- **Conditional drawdown flows:** `requestDrawdown()` checks amount against limit, verifies no active position, and either transfers directly or emits `LiquidityShortfall` for CRE to handle. Two distinct code paths based on available liquidity.
- **Multi-step settlement:** PSP repays in EURC → Pool holds the EURC → emits `RepaymentReceived` → CRE converts via Uniswap → calls `processConvertedRepayment()` → splits into principal (back to pool) and fee (to YieldReserve). Four contracts involved in a single repayment.
- **Chainlink Price Feed integration:** Pool.sol imports `IAggregatorV3` and exposes `getLatestPrice()` and `verifyConversionRate()` for on-chain EURC/USD price verification before swaps.
- **Dual token support:** USDC (`0x3600...`) as base asset, EURC (`0x89B5...`) for multi-token repayments.

Key files:
- `contracts/src/Pool.sol` — Core pool with conditional drawdown, multi-step repayment, Chainlink Price Feed
- `contracts/src/YieldReserve.sol` — Fee accumulation and yield distribution
- `contracts/src/interfaces/IAggregatorV3.sol` — Chainlink Price Feed interface

**Nanopayments ($6K track)**

Four autonomous AI agents transact via Circle Nanopayments on Arc using the x402 protocol:

- **Data Service (sell side):** Three x402-protected endpoints — credit score ($0.01), compliance check ($0.005), market data ($0.002). Uses `@circle-fin/x402-batching/server` with `createGatewayMiddleware`.
- **Pool Monitor Agent (buyer AND seller):** Buys raw market data from Data Service ($0.002), processes it into pool health analysis, then sells that analysis to other agents ($0.003). This is genuine agent-to-agent commerce.
- **Credit Risk Agent:** Before every PSP drawdown, pays three data sources — Pool Monitor ($0.003) + Data Service credit score ($0.01) + Data Service compliance ($0.005) = $0.018 per assessment. Returns risk score and recommendation.
- **Repayment Reminder Agent:** Pays for compliance re-checks and pool health when drawdown approaches repayment window.

All payments are gas-free EIP-3009 signed authorizations on Arc, settled in batch by Circle Gateway. Total of $0.022 spent across 5 paid API calls, verifiable on-chain.

Key files:
- `agent/src/dataService.ts` — x402-protected sell-side endpoints
- `agent/src/poolMonitorAgent.ts` — Buys AND sells (agent-to-agent)
- `agent/src/creditRiskAgent.ts` — Pays 3 sources per assessment
- `agent/src/agentClient.ts` — GatewayClient on arcTestnet

### Uniswap Foundation

PayMate uses the Uniswap Trading API as the conversion and liquidity layer across four integration points:

1. **CRE shortfall handler:** When the pool can't cover a drawdown, the CRE workflow calls `/quote` to source USDC from Uniswap liquidity pools on Base. Uses Confidential HTTP to keep the API key private.
2. **CRE repayment conversion:** When a PSP repays in EURC, CRE calls `/quote` to get the EURC→USDC conversion rate, then processes the converted amount on-chain.
3. **Backend rate API:** `/api/uniswap/rates` endpoint calls the Uniswap `/quote` endpoint for live EURC/USDC rates, served to the frontend.
4. **Frontend conversion preview:** PSP repay page shows real-time preview ("5 EURC → 5.76 USDC") powered by Uniswap quotes before the user commits.

A swap execution script (`uniswap-swap.ts`) demonstrates the full `/quote` → `/swap` → on-chain execution flow on Unichain Sepolia.

Key files:
- `cre-workflow/paymate-workflow/workflow.ts` — CRE handlers calling Uniswap API
- `backend/src/routes/uniswap.ts` — Backend rate and quote endpoints
- `frontend/components/uniswap-rates.tsx` — Live rate display and quote preview
- `contracts/scripts/uniswap-swap.ts` — Real swap execution script

### Chainlink

PayMate uses three Chainlink services:

**CRE Workflow ($4K track)**

A TypeScript workflow compiled to WASM with three handlers:
- **Cron trigger (yield distribution):** Every 7 days, reads LP balances from Pool contract on Arc, calculates pro-rata yield shares, ABI-encodes a report, calls `YieldReserve.onReport()` then `Pool.distributeYield()`.
- **EVM log trigger (liquidity shortfall):** Listens for `LiquidityShortfall` events. Calls Uniswap API for a quote, verifies against Chainlink Price Feed, calls `Pool.completeDrawdown()`.
- **EVM log trigger (repayment conversion):** Listens for `RepaymentReceived` events. Converts non-USDC to USDC via Uniswap, calls `Pool.processConvertedRepayment()`.

All three simulations pass via CRE CLI. Generated type-safe contract bindings via `cre generate-bindings evm`.

**Connect the World ($1K track)**

- Pool.sol imports `IAggregatorV3` and implements `setPriceFeed()`, `getLatestPrice()`, and `verifyConversionRate()` — Chainlink Price Feeds used directly inside smart contracts.
- CRE workflow reads the Chainlink EURC/USD price feed on Base to verify Uniswap quotes.
- CRE makes three state changes on-chain: `distributeYield()`, `completeDrawdown()`, `processConvertedRepayment()`.
- Two Chainlink services used meaningfully: CRE + Price Feeds.

**Privacy Standard ($2K track)**

The CRE workflow uses `ConfidentialHTTPClient` for Uniswap API calls in production mode:
- Go template secret injection: `{{.uniswapApiKey}}` resolved inside secure enclave
- `vaultDonSecrets` configured for enclave-only secret access
- API key, swap amounts, and routing data stay private
- `useConfidentialHttp` config flag toggles between confidential (production) and regular (simulation) HTTP paths

Key files:
- `cre-workflow/paymate-workflow/workflow.ts` — All three handlers + Confidential HTTP
- `contracts/src/Pool.sol` — Chainlink Price Feed integration (lines 240-260)
- `contracts/src/interfaces/IAggregatorV3.sol` — Chainlink interface
